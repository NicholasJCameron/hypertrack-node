#### Getting Started

If you want to familiarize yourself with the project, you can start by [forking the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and [cloning it in your local development environment](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/). The project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) to be installed on your machine.

After cloning the repository, install the dependencies by running the following command in the directory of your cloned repository:

```bash
npm install
```

You can run the existing tests to see if everything is okay by executing:

```bash
npm test
```

To run just one specific test file instead of the whole suite, provide a JavaScript regular expression that will match your spec file's name, like:

```bash
npm run test -- -m .\*client.\*
```
